# Music 2016
==========

### NEW RELEASES

- Xiu Xiu - Plays Music from Twin Peaks
	Twin Peaks is almost too easy a tribute-concept to work from... Unless you have pipes like Jamie Stewart's. Then it becomes necessary.

- Badbadnotgood - IV
	Badbadnotgood can seem to do no wrong. Their darker, moodier Boiler Room Basement set still goes into heavy rotation for me, and this project's got a great mix of old and new styles for them.

- Hieroglyphic Being - The Disco's of Imhotep
	Somewhere out there, there's a party going until 7am with every one of these songs on non-stop, and I'm not there to witness it... Best dance tracks of the year.

- Liima - ii
	Efterklang's one of my all time favourite bands (Parades in particular still holds a special place for me), and easily one of the best to see live, so I was ecstatic to hear this side project from them with Tatu Rönkkö.  Great video for 'Russians' too.

- Street Sects - End Position
	To paraphrase a better man's phrasing than I, "I just gotta' be true to my Death Grips-dickriding heart". DG had another solid release this year but an unexpected surprise, Street Sects came out of nowhere and just won it out for me. Fresh and nasty.

- Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith & Suzanne Ciani - Sunergy
	Wow, what a surprise this was. I heard 'EARS' earlier in the year from Smith, but this collab. project with Suzanne Ciani (whom I also, shamefully, hadn't heard of until this year) just blew it out of the water. There's hints of some of the moodier, soundscape tracks from Crystal Castles 'II' (ie. 'I am made of Chalk'), stretched out to 12+ minutes, ditched the angsty vibe and grew up a bit. Sidenote: what a disappointment this year from CC :(

- Floex (Thomas Dvorak) - Samorost 3 OST
	So, one of my favourite games of the year's soundtrack is making this list, so I'm likely showing my bias. I hold Machinarium up there with Monkey Island 1 & 2 as one of the best Adventure games ever however, so Amanita Design's latest definitely struck a similar nerve for me. * I highly recommend checking either title/soundtrack out, and Thomas Dvorak makes amazingly atmospheric vibes, blending a variety of styles and instruments, so it's always a thrill to see what he's done for a new project. * If I had one complaint: not as much saxaphone on the recorded release as I would have liked!

- Blood Bitch - Jenny Hval
	Great piece from a new artist for me [more later…]
	


----------------------------

### HONORABLE MENTIONS

Avalanches - Wildflower
	- They're back! Great to hear them back again, but the hype caught up with them a bit for me. Not as great as 'Since I left You', but then, what is?

- Jefre Cantu-Ledesma - In Summer
	Sweet experimental ambient from Cantu-Ledesma, and I'm a sucker for albums with an 'aural diary' concept.

CFCF - On Vacation
	- Not as consistent as some of his recent stuff, but some great songs in here. Lighthouse on Chatham Sound is just wonderful.

Death Grips - Bottomless Pit
	- FUCK BLOOM BAM, FUCK BAM BLEW, FUCK BOOM BLAM. Yeah, I just can't hate these guys. Saw them live too in October!

The Gloaming - 2
	- Wonderful, wonderful contemporary Irish music from the supergroup with Martin Hayes! Try listening to 'The Old Favourite' above and tell me you're not charmed. Can't be done. Simply can't.

Disasterpeace - Hyper Light Drifter
	- I'll admit, I was a little underwhelmed with Hyper Light Drifter. It looks amazing, and played quite well, but I've definitely been spoiled for ruined-world, post-narrative worldbuilding by the From Software titles. The overly-ambiguous history and simplified narrative style of HLD just didn't suit the setting for me. Soundtrack was solid however, more of Disasterpeace is always good.

Mammal Hands - Floa
	Nice recommendation from my friend Barry.

Carlos Nino & Friends - Flutes, Echos, It's All Happening!

----------------------------

### REVISITS

Bjork - Vulnicura
	Ok, I have to put up my hands with this one, I completely missed this last year, and feel tremendously guilty for it because it's just gut-wrenching. So so good, would have definitely made the cut in last year's list.

James Ferraro - Far Side Virtual

Blank Banshee - Blank Banshee 1

Mac Demario - Live & Acoustic Vol. 1

Chuck Person - Eccojam Vol. 1
	This was a  great new find for me this year, and possibly the one I played over and over the most. I loved uncovering it more and more on each playthrough.

Tim Hecker - Virgins

Tychonaut - This is Tychonaut
	A little known Irish band (originally called 'The Tycho Brahe') that came and went, but not before leaving us with a great album. One of those albums from my teenage years that brings back a lot of memories.

Bohren&Den Club of Gore - Black Earth
	Super moody. Like, mood-zilla moody.

----------------------------

### SINGLES/ EP 2016

Meltybrains? - Know My Name
	How are these guys not more famous than they are yet? Saw them back at Electric Picnic, 2014 and they were the best thing there by a mile. 

Safe and Sound - Justice
	Funky. Good to hear them back, although really, is their plan to just follow in all of Daft Punk's footsteps?

L. Pierre - Sundrunk
	I love-love-love me some L. Pierre, and this was a pleasantly light and happy song for here. Go check out 'The Island Come True' if you want an album that'll haunt you.

Dan Deacon - Change your life (you can do it
	YOU CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT~
	Still haven't seen him live tho ;-;

Qrion - sad af
	Great mix on one of her older tracks.

-------------------------------

### HONORABLE MENTIONS #2
Chance the Rapper - Coloring Book
Kanye - Life of Pablo
Frank Ocean - Blond
MMOTHS - Luneworks
Bon Iver - 22, A Million (music for bedwetters)
	If there was ever any indication  Kanye and Justin Vernon were spending maybe a little too much time hanging out together, this was the year for both artists.

----------------------------

### SINGLES OLDIES
Patrice Rushen - Forget Me Nots
Avalanches - Everyday
Artful Dodger - Movin' too fast
The Atlas Mountains (Reprise) - Bliss
Paddy Mulcahy - Sophie's Theme (Live)
David Bowie - Subterraneans

----------------------------

### REMOVED -  The ones that didn’t make it

Charlie XCX - Vroom Vroom
	This one grew on me, albeit it took a while. Really it's a solid, if typically glitzy, PC Music EP once you get around the harsher edges.

Mensa Group International - Mini

Matmos - Ultimate Care ii
	Hilarious concept, and they really smashed it.

Yves Tumor - Serpent Music
	Weird and wonderful.

case/lang/veirs - case/lang/veirs
	A little inconsistent, but some great songs in here.

Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein - Stranger Things, Vol. 1 
	The 2016 TV that was great on a first watch, and then grew steadily less impressive the more I pondered on it... A shame. Soundtrack never lost it's luster on me however, a great set.

Replica - Oneohtrix Point Never
	Solid revisit.
