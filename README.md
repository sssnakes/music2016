# music2016

Music listing site for 2016, mainly to teach myself some PHP and to use Github more.

# CHANGELOG

0.01
- Strange bug with Dummy text left below?

0.02
- .list-title not entirely fixed :/

0.10
- Had a new design idea whilst on holiday, starting fresh with a few retainers.

0.12
- List Scroll working (mostly). Right side panel still needs absolute position fixing. Left side panel works well. Attempted Info bottom panel but went real bad, try again soon.
